A computer geek, a techie or a gadget freak. That's how the people around me
would describe me. From an early age I have had a passion for everything tech.
In primary school I was always pulled out of class to solve problems with a printer or a digital whiteboard. And nothing has changed in that regard.
Whether I'm playing a shooting game, programming an Arduino for a sim racing
handbrake or looking up useless facts, you can still find me often
behind a computer screen.
